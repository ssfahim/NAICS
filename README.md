<h1>Canadian NAICS Codes</h1>

<p>This project is designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the Canadian North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The NAICS system is a crucial tool for businesses, allowing them to classify their economic activities, identify competitors, and gain insights into industry trends.</p>

<h2>Why This Project?</h2>

<p>The primary goal of this project is to make the Canadian NAICS codes easily accessible and navigable. Here are some key reasons why this project was created:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Competitive Analysis and Benchmarking</strong>: By using NAICS codes, businesses can identify their competitors, analyze market share, and benchmark their performance against industry standards [1][3][6>.</li>
    <li><strong>Target Market Identification</strong>: NAICS codes help businesses identify potential customers within specific markets or industries, enabling them to expand their customer base effectively [1][2][6>.</li>
    <li><strong>Industry Research and Trend Analysis</strong>: NAICS codes provide valuable insights into emerging technologies, changing consumer preferences, and market shifts, helping businesses stay ahead of industry trends [1][3][8>.</li>
    <li><strong>Government Contracts and Incentives</strong>: Accurate NAICS codes are essential for participating in government contracts and accessing tax incentives. They help businesses navigate federal programs and opportunities [2][6][8>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The project includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive Hierarchical Tree</strong>: The NAICS codes are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure, allowing users to navigate from 2-digit sector codes to 6-digit specific codes.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Functionality</strong>: A search bar enables users to quickly find specific NAICS codes or titles, with the matched item and its hierarchical path displayed in an expanded state.</li>
